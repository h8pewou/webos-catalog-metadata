  "description": "Revisionist History Note - This is a build of the official 2.1.2 release for webOS. Its been tested only on TouchPad, and improves on the previous 1.4 App Catalog release and 2017 Preware release, as well as my own 2020 release of 2.0.0, by compiling the final ScummVM bits that supported webOS. I'm responsible only for the build, and I make no claims on the source project, which is created by an expert team of volunteers that can be found at www.scummvm.org. Game compatibility can be found at that site, but a list of games added in this build is here: https://www.scummvm.org/news/20191013/",
  "version": "2.1.0200",
  "versionNote": "ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point & click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. \n\nAfter first start of ScummVM a directory structure is created on the USB drive. Copy the game files into the \"ScummVM/Games\" folder and then you can add the games in ScummVM. \n\nScummVM is controlled like this: \n\n* Flick two fingers downward for the menu\n* Flick two fingers upward for the keyboard (webOS 3 only)\n* Flick two fingers left to emulate the Escape key (Back gesture also works when available)\n* Flick two fingers right to toggle Touchpad Mode.\n* Flick three fingers right to toggle Auto-Drag Mode.\n     # When this is on, put a finger on screen and hold still for half a second to start dragging.\n     # Whether it's on or off, you can always double-tap and hold to start dragging, just like you would on a computer trackpad.\n* Flick three fingers down to pause and unpause (forgive the spacebar message)\n* Tap with one finger to click normally.\n* Tap a second finger with one already touching the screen for a right-click.\n* Tap a third finger with two already on screen for a middle-click.\n\nTouchpad Mode is what older ScummVM WebOS ports used. This is now OFF by default. When on, you move the finger on the screen, and the mouse pointer moves relative to it -- just like using a laptop trackpad.\n\nWhen Touchpad Mode is OFF (default) the pointer will move to exactly where you tap, so tapping on an object clicks that object. If you put your finger on the screen and slide it around, you can hover over objects on the screen (useful to see what they are) without risking clicking on them.\n\nAuto-Drag Mode is useful for games like Curse of Monkey Island and Full Throttle that require you to hold down the mouse button to access the possible actions. You can still put your finger on screen and immediately slide it around to hover over things without clicking.",
