  "description": "Sync iMessages from your Mac to your Touchpad with this Synergy Connector, and the free Message Bridge software from dremin.\n\nOne of a very few Synergy Connectors, and certainly the only one built in the last decade, this bundle includes a background service and configuration front-end to make it easy to seamlessly sync messages onto your webOS device. Initially its a one-way sync -- no outbound messages yet. Also initially, it only supports the Touchpad, due to the old version of NodeJS on webOS 2.x. I plan to continue development for as long as its useful to me, so more to come hopefully.\n\nTo use this, you'll need a Mac, signed into your Apple Account for messages, and the Message Bridge connector available from GitHub: https://github.com/dremin/message-bridge",
  "version": "1.0.2",
  "versionNote": "1.0.0 - Initial public release. Supports Touchpads and one-way sync only.\r\n1.0.1 - Add partial support for Pre3 and other devices running 2.2.4, fixes some bugs.\r\n1.0.2 - Fix (I hope!) a nasty race condition that can cause messages to appear repeatedly. Requires removal of previous version, Luna restart, then fresh install!",
