  "description": "drPodder Redux combines the best of drPodder and GutenPodder with webOS Archive services to provide the best podcasting experience across all webOS Mobile devices. The TouchPad layout has been refined, while gesture controls for phones have been restored. Dead features have been stripped out, making way for upcoming integration with the webOS Archive Podcast Directory.\r\n\nThis version upgrades drPodder from the App Museum, adopting its database and launcher icon, but will coexist with drPodder HB (from Preware) and GutenPodder, if you want to continue to use those. The GPLv3 license is maintained and adhered to.\r\n\nPALM HOT APPS CONTEST WINNER!\n\nUPDATE: webOS 2.0 Compatible\n\ndrPodder allows you to keep track of audio and video podcasts on your webOS device without the need to hook up to a computer!\n\nSome Radio programs even have Podcast feeds you can add.  You can add new podcasts by URL or search a directory.  Podcasts can be updated on demand or through scheduled updates.\n\nPlayback streaming or downloaded podcasts.  Optional background downloading of new podcasts.  Automatic bookmarking for audio podcasts so you can finish later.  Playlist support to group your podcasts together & play through them all at once.\n\nIncludes sample podcasts such as:\n  - TWiT\n  - Stuff You Should Know\n  - PalmCast - one of the original podcasts about all things Palm has been partially restored for drPodder users!",
