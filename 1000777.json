  "description": "Curator's Note - Although limited by being a U.S.-only service (you might be able to get around with the webOS Archive Proxy Service!) this app still works flawlessly as of 2021. Playlists, songs, likes -- and no ads! I've found this to be the best Pandora client on the Touchpad, and has never exhibited the problems other apps have of dying after a couple songs. Versions for Veer, Pre2 and Pre3 have been recovered from the original author, and are available in the Museum -- just search the Music section for Apollo!\r\n\nApollo is a third-party client for Pandora Radio.\n\n(Check in-app changelog for new features/changes)\n\nFeatures include:\n\n-Creation of new Pandora accounts\n-Sign in with existing Pandora accounts\n-Creation/Deletion of stations\n-Bookmark management (bookmark current/recent song/artist, view/delete bookmarks)\n-Like & dislike of songs\n-Skip current song (6 skips/hr/station)\n-Viewing of recent tracks for each station\n-Create station from current song/artist, recent song/artist, bookmark song/artist\n-Put song to sleep for one month\n-Links to browse music on Amazon.com\n-Sorting of stations by name or date of creation\n-Viewing of current song artist biography\n-Explanation of why current song is playing\n-Dashboard (Notification) controls (like/dislike, pause/play, skip)\n-Song progress in dashboard\n-Dashboard controllable from lock-screen\n-Settings: audio quality, selectable backgrounds, full screen toggle, application timeout, toggle auto-play station on app startup, simple/full exhibition, Villo statistics\n-Exhibition mode\n\nAll this paired with an excellent UI which makes use of Enyo 1.0 (sliding panes and other niceties).\n\n\"..This app is flawless. Great job. You, sir, have just made the TouchPad a little better.\" - jsgraphicart\n\n\"This is an impressive app. The amount of work that was spent on design and efficiency is noticeable... Top of the line quality. \" - Kevin B\n\n\"I normally don't write reviews, but Apollo is such a good app that I've been compelled to do so.\" - Awjin A\n\n\"A well designed app. Beautiful in its simplicity.\" - Kevin T\n\n**All feedback is highly encouraged, negative or positive. Please review the app and let us know what you think. Remember, constructive criticism will allow us to fix and improve the app in order to provide the best available user experience**","originalCategory":"Music",
