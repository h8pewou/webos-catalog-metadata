  "description": "The Coolest RSS Reader Client for webOS, LuneOS, and Firefox OS! Supporting Feedly, AOL Reader, The Old Reader, InoReader, BazQux Reader, Tiny Tiny RSS, and OwnCloud News.\n\nFollowing the shutdown of Google Reader on July 1, 2013, this is a fork of SemicolonApps' excellent (and unfortunately no longer supported) Google Reader app Feeder to create a client that is compatible with Feedly's API, The Old Reader's beta API, InoReader's API, BazQux Reader's API, Tiny Tiny RSS's API, AOL Reader's API, and OwnCloud News' API. Now, webOS users can again sync their RSS Feeds across all of their webOS devices. \n\nWhat works? All the basics: \n- Loading Subscriptions \n- Reading Articles \n- Marking articles as read/unread \n- Marking all articles in a subscription as read/unread \n- Sharing via email/sms/Twitter/Facebook\n- Adding/Removing Subscriptions\n- \"Star\"ing or \"Like\"ing items.\n- [InoReader and Tiny Tiny RSS] Sharing items via the \"shared\" feed.\n\nWhat doesn't work yet:\n\n- [AOL Reader, The Old Reader, Feedly, OwnCloud News and BazQux Reader] Sharing items via the \"shared\" feed. This is also a limitation of the API and cannot be fixed until the API is updated.\n- [The Old Reader, InoReader, and BazQux Reader] Logging in via your Google/Facebook account (OAuth). Again, limitation of the API. At the moment, you can set a password in the web interface and log in using that.\n- Searching your feeds.\n- [Feedly on webOS 1.4.5 only] Cannot delete folders, unsubscribe from feeds, or unstar items. Also, must re-login every week or so. This is due to the version of webkit used by 1.4.5. Later versions work correctly.\n- [OwnCloud News on webOS 1.4.5 only] Cannot delete folders or unsubscribe from feeds. This is due to the version of webkit used by 1.4.5. Later versions work correctly.\n\nAs the APIs mature, the app will be updated to support all of these things. In the meantime, enjoy your news feeds! \n\nNeed support or have questions?

  "versionNote": "Revisionist History Note - Version 2.1.0 was released in 2020 by the original author, and can be considered a replacement for previous versions. Everything is fully functional, save for some of the Share options, which depend on services that no longer work (such as Facebook.) For phones with smaller screens or no Enyo, check out FeedSpider 1.2.6 in the Curator's Choice section.\r\n\nVersion 2.3.1 - Re-factored cross platform release for Android, webOS and PWA (Desktop and Apple mobile devices) as of 2022. Distributed with permission. This version improves support for LuneOS.\r\nVersion 2.3.2 - Sync changes to Android and PWA releases: cleans-up dead Share paths, adds option to Disable Gesture Navigation.\r\nVersion 2.3.3 - Move to new app domain. This update is required.",
