  "description": "Revisionist History Note - This app is different than both the historical app in the Museum, and the current Grabber version on Preware, in that it has been (at least somewhat) optimized for TouchPad use (without any impact to phone use.) The cards now fill the screen, and a 'Go Back' menu option has been added. As of 1.4.7 some additional bugs were fixed, and support for the App Museum auto-updater was added. The built-in WebOS Nation bookmark has also been revised so its easier to join in on the forums!",
