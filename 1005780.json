  "description": "Revisionist History Note: This app is also in Preware, but I've been unable to download it there and attempts to update that repo get held up for months, so this is now the repository of record for Night Moves going forward.\r\n\r\nNight Moves is a utility along the lines of f.lux or or Night Panel on other OSes -- save that it doesn't actually change color temperature, since there's no API for that in webOS. What it does instead is changes the screen brightness and volume (both System and Ringtone) on a schedule that you set.",
